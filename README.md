# ✈️ Flight Planner — Intelligent Route Optimization

A full-stack web application that finds optimal flight routes between Indian cities using custom graph algorithms. Built with a **Next.js** frontend and a **FastAPI** backend, powered by real-time flight data from the **AirLabs API**.

---

## 🚀 Live Demo

Select any two cities — the app automatically fetches all three optimal routes simultaneously (no manual searching required).

---

## 🧠 How It Works

The system models flights as a **directed weighted graph**:
- **Nodes** → Cities
- **Edges** → Flights (weighted by fare and time)

On every search, **three strategies run in parallel** and results are shown as tabs:

| Strategy | Algorithm | Optimizes For |
|---|---|---|
| 💰 **Cheapest** | Dijkstra / Min-Heap | Lowest total fare |
| ⚡ **Fastest** | BFS + Priority Queue | Fewest flights, earliest arrival |
| 🎯 **Best Value** | BFS + Priority Queue | Fewest flights, then cheapest fare |

## 🗂️ Data Structures Implemented (from scratch)

All custom — no standard library collections used for core logic:

- **Adjacency List Graph** — flight network representation
- **Linked List Queue** — O(1) enqueue/dequeue for BFS
- **Min-Heap / Priority Queue** — Dijkstra fare optimization

---

## 🚦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+
- An [AirLabs API key](https://airlabs.co) (free tier — 1,000 req/month)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prathivds08/Flight-Planner.git
cd Flight-Planner
```

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend

# Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
# source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set your AirLabs API key:
# AIRLABS_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

#### Verify your AirLabs API key

```bash
python ping_airlabs.py
```

This runs a full diagnostic — checks key validity, quota remaining, and whether real flight data is returned per airport.

#### Start the backend

```bash
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## 🔍 How Time Constraints Work

The time-slots endpoint is **route-aware**:

1. When both cities are selected, the backend first runs all three algorithms with the widest possible window.
2. Only the departure/arrival times that appear in **actual valid routes** are surfaced in the dropdowns.
3. This guarantees every selectable time produces at least one result — no "No routes found" dead ends.

---

## 🧪 Diagnostics

```bash
# Check AirLabs API status and data quality
cd backend
python ping_airlabs.py
```

Output includes:
- API key validity and quota usage
- Number of valid flights per airport
- Sample parsed flight times
- Summary of whether live data is usable

## 📊 Algorithm Details

### Cheapest Route — Dijkstra on Fares
Uses a **min-heap** keyed on cumulative fare. Explores cheapest paths first. Stops as soon as the destination is dequeued (guaranteed optimal).

### Fastest Route — BFS with Arrival Tracking
Uses a **FIFO queue** (BFS) with pruning: only explores a city again if the new path reaches it with fewer flights or (at the same count) an earlier arrival.

### Best Value — BFS with Fare Tracking
Same structure as Fastest, but tie-breaks on fare instead of arrival time.

**Constraint for all strategies:** Each connecting flight must depart at least **20 minutes** after the previous flight's arrival to allow for connection time.
